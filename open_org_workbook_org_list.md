## Framework for case studies
Each case study should profile the organization with:
- Number of employees
- Description of company
- Assessment of "open" (e.g. Does the organization use the language of open source in some way? Where do we think they fall on the Maturity Model)

Each case study should answer (at minimum) the following questions:

- What was the **problem** the organization was facing?
- What **solution**, based on principles from the [Open Organization Definition](https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/open-org-definition), did it implement to solve this problem?
- What was **outcome** of this work?
